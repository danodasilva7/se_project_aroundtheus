# Around The U.S.

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief via Figma.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- Using Figma
- Responsive Design

## Plan on improving the project

Everything in the project was recently used in previous projects besides Figma and Responsive Design. By using both this helped improve the responsiveness and accuracy of the webpage. I plan on increasing my knowledge of responsive design and the use of Figma through more projects down the line. I feel as though I have not learned the entirety of both subjects just yet. There is more to learn and improve.

## Prjoect Description

Simply created a functioning website that includes responsive design to resolutions of 320px, 775px, and 1280px or >. Everything acquired to design the project the website was from Figma; Images, Buttons, Fonts, Colors, Opacity, Pointers, Width, Height, and Margins. This website should respond accordingly to each of the different resolutions. This includes the Fonts, Images, Buttons, and Title.
